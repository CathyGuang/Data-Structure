One thing that surprised us is that when we tried to sort countries based on total greenhouse gas emissions. We noticed that countries with higher income have lower amount of emissions, and also less population in total. We think this is because the wealthier countries may have more to invest in alternative energy forms instead of more harmful sources. In addition, we tried to relate wealth with birth rate. We hypothesize that wealthier and more developed countries may have a lower population growth rate and birth rate because more people are educated and are pursuing a higher degree in their lives. This can be a question worth further discussion.

We also examined that the top 10 countries in terms of percentage of terrestrial protected areas have very low urban population growth. Also, the bottom 10 countries in terms of percentage of terrestial protected areas have slightly greater levels of urban population growth, with the exception of the Syrian Arab Republic which had a negative urban population growth rate. 

When we look at the top 10 countries in terms of percentage of terrestrial protected areas, we can see that they have relatively low levels of CO2 emissions. We hypothesize that these countries pay more attention to enviromental conservation based their amounts of terrestrial protected areas.
